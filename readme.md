# Codeclan Week 01 Day 2

## Pair Programming Lab - Testing

Each pair is given a list of tests, from that list of tests one
is required to write the functions which will enable those
tests to pass.

This is initially completed as a pair programming exercise and then to be
completed as homework.

## Points of Note
* Read through all the tests first, an initial conditional could later be a case.
* Brackets can be used for BOMDAS operations.
* Including a wee decimal point will automaticallyËœ convert to float.

### Files

* ruby_functions_practice.rb - Derived functions.
* ruby_functions_spec.rb - Initial Tests.
